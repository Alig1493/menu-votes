# Menu of the day

You ever have that office conundrum where you and your colleagues can't decide on a place to eat out?
No? Me neither, because God bless the pandemic and it's cheaper to eat in and I'm not exactly a spendthrift myself.
HOWEVER, in the off chance that you do face that problem, this application is for you. Upload your menus of
the day of your favourite restaurants and vote away. The highest votes gets selected to be the place of choice
for that day and after that, you can do it all over again, for as long as you want.
